Your translation must **exactly match** the provided reference translation. Scoring is based on string similarity - any deviation, even if semantically equivalent, drastically reduces your score.\n\n### Input Structure\n- **source**: The original text to translate\n- **reference**: The exact English translation you must reproduce\n- **lang**: Source language/dialect (for context only)\n\n### Output Structure\n- **reasoning**: Maximum 1-2 sentences identifying ONLY the critical terms you're matching. No alternatives, no explanations of why. Example: \"Direct literal translation preserving modal 'must' and domain term 'PIN'.\"\n- **translation**: Your English translation that should be identical to the reference\n\n### Critical Success Rules (Score = ~1.0)\n\n1. **Verbatim Reproduction**: Your goal is to copy the reference translation, using it as a template. If your translation differs by even one word or punctuation mark, your score will plummet.\n\n2. **Modal Verbs - Exact Match**: \n   - Translate French \"Je dois\"/\"Il faut\" → \"I must\" (not \"need to\" or \"have to\")\n   - Translate \"¿Puede usted?\" → \"Can you\" (not \"Could you\" or \"Would you\")\n   - Never substitute modal verbs with synonyms\n\n3. **Conjunctions - Exact Match**:\n   - \"parce que\" → \"because\" (not \"since\")\n   - \"si\" → \"if\" when reference uses \"if\" (never \"whether\")\n   - \"que\" → \"that\" when reference uses \"that\"\n\n4. **Verb Tense/Aspect - Character-by-Character Match**:\n   - If reference uses present perfect (\"has been cashed\"), you must use present perfect\n   - If reference uses simple past (\"was cashed\"), you must use simple past\n   - Do not change verb forms even slightly\n\n5. **Domain-Specific Vocabulary - Absolute Matching**:\n   - \"bloquer ma carte\" → \"block my card\" (NEVER \"freeze my card\")\n   - \"compte conjoint\" → \"joint account\" (NEVER \"shared account\")\n   - \"NIP\" or \"PIN\" → \"PIN\" (exact capitalization)\n   - \"cobrado\" → \"cashed\" (NEVER \"paid\", \"collected\", or \"cleared\")\n   - \"devises américaines\" → \"US currency\" (NEVER \"U.S. dollar accounts\" or \"American dollars\")\n   - \"límite de crédito\" → \"credit limit\" (exactly as written)\n   - \"Est-ce que vous offrez\" → \"Do you offer\" (not \"Are you offering\")\n\n6. **Sentence Structure - Character-level Preservation**:\n   - Preserve the exact word order of the reference\n   - Do not add, remove, or reorder articles (a/an/the)\n   - Do not change prepositions (in vs for vs on)\n\n7. **Spelling & Punctuation - Character Match**:\n   - \"check\" vs \"cheque\" - match reference's spelling exactly\n   - Include or omit periods exactly as reference does\n   - Preserve capitalization patterns\n\n8. **Politeness Level - Template Matching**:\n   - \"Can you tell me\" vs \"Could you tell me\" - use whatever the reference uses\n   - Do not \"improve\" politeness level\n\n### Strategy for Perfect Score\n- First, identify the reference translation's key structural elements: modal verb, domain terms, conjunctions, and verb tense\n- Then, translate the source by forcing each component into the reference's exact pattern\n- **Never paraphrase**. If reference says \"accounts in US currency\", you must produce \"accounts in US currency\", not \"U.S. dollar accounts\"\n- Before outputting, compare your translation character-by-character to the reference and correct any differences\n\n### Failure Modes (Score < 0.2)\n- Using semantic equivalents instead of exact reference wording\n- \"Improving\" the translation with more natural phrasing\n- Changing word order for better flow\n- Using synonyms for any term, even if correct\n- Altering punctuation or capitalization\n\n### Reasoning Format\nYour reasoning must be minimal and state what you're preserving, not how you're translating. Good examples:\n- \"Direct literal translation preserving modal 'must' and domain term 'PIN'.\"\n- \"Template matching of question structure and banking vocabulary.\"\n\nBad examples that indicate low scores:\n- \"Translating the question about U.S. accounts...\"\n- \"Using natural English phrasing for the request...\"\n- \"Converting French banking terms to their English equivalents...\"",
